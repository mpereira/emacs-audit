** Install

  =emacs-audit= is currently not published to Melpa.

*** Quelpa

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (quelpa
     '(emacs-audit
       :fetcher url
       :url "https://github.com/mpereira/emacs-audit/releases/download/1.0.0-snapshot/emacs-audit.el"))
    (require 'emacs-audit)
    #+end_src

    Alternatively, if [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/][use-package]] and [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa-use-package][quelpa-use-package]] are installed:

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package emacs-audit
      :ensure nil
      :quelpa (emacs-audit
               :fetcher url
               :url "https://github.com/mpereira/emacs-audit/releases/download/1.0.0-snapshot/emacs-audit.el"))
    #+end_src

*** Manually

    =emacs-audit= depends on:
    - dash
    - elx
    - json
    - package
    - s
    - tablist

    Install them using =M-x package install RET <package> RET=.

    Then create a directory for =emacs-audit= under your Emacs installation
    directory (usually =~/.emacs.d=):

    #+begin_src bash
    mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-audit/lisp
    #+end_src

    Then download =emacs-audit.el= into that directory:

    #+begin_src bash
    curl -sL \
         https://github.com/mpereira/emacs-audit/releases/download/1.0.0-snapshot/emacs-audit.el \
         -o ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-audit/lisp/emacs-audit.el
    #+end_src

    Finally add this to your init file:

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/emacs-audit/lisp")
    (require 'emacs-audit)
    #+end_src

    Evaluate the elisp above if you're doing this from a running Emacs instance.

** Usage

   After installing it for the first time you'll need to run the setup function
   once:

   #+begin_src text
   M-x emacs-audit-setup RET
   #+end_src

   After that, run

   #+begin_src text
   M-x emacs-audit-list-packages RET
   #+end_src

   to see the the package list buffer. The package list buffer mode inherits
   from =tablist-mode= so you can use commands from both tablist and
   tabulated-list modes, most importantly:

   - =tablist-forward-column=
   - =tablist-backward-column=

   to move around and

   - =tabulated-list-narrow-current-column=
   - =tabulated-list-widen-current-column=
   - =tablist-sort=

   to interact with the buffer.

** Configuration

*** Buffer opening behavior

    The buffer listing packages is relatively wide so I recommend you set a
    [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/The-Zen-of-Buffer-Display.html][~display-buffer-alist~]] entry for opening a full-width, half-height window in
    your current frame for it. This also achieves a consistent open behavior for
    this buffer.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'display-buffer-alist '("\\*emacs-audit: package-list\\*"
                                         (display-buffer-in-side-window)
                                         (window-height . 0.5)
                                         (window-width . 0.5)
                                         (slot . 0)
                                         (mode-line-format . (" " "%b"))))
    #+end_src

    Of course, you're free to configure this any way you want. Watch [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjOhJMbA-q0][this video]]
    if you're still not too familiar with ~display-buffer-alist~.

*** Custom GitHub token

    =emacs-audit= fetches data from the GitHub GraphQL API, which requires a
    personal access token. The binaries provided in the [[https://github.com/mpereira/emacs-audit/releases][releases]] use a default
    token so _you don't need to configure this_.

    If for whatever reason you do want to to use a custom token, check out [[https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql][the
    documentation]] for instructions on how to create one. Then add the following
    to your configuration:

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq emacs-audit-github-token "SOME-TOKEN")
    #+end_src

** Development

   =emacs-audit= runs a Rust program to fetch data used to enrich local package
   information. =M-x emacs-audit-setup= downloads a platform-dependent,
   versioned binary from the GitHub releases.

   To work with a local clone of the =emacs-audit= git repository run =M-x
   emacs-audit-development-mode-toggle= so that =cargo run= is used instead of
   the downloaded binary.

*** Sync =emacs-audit.el= [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Headers.html][library header]] "commentary" section with =README.org=

    1. Visit =elisp/emacs-audit.el=
    2. Move point to over the line with the =* emacs-audit= commented out headline
    3. Call =M-x mpereira/outorg-edit-as-org=
    4. Paste relevant portions of =README.org= to the =*outorg-edit-buffer*= buffer
    5. Switch to the =*outorg-edit-buffer*= buffer
    6. Eval ~(setq-local org-adapt-indentation nil)~
    7. Run =M-x mpereira/indent-buffer=
    8. Save buffer
    9. Run =M-x mpereira/outorg-copy-edits-and-exit=
    10. Comment out uncommented Emacs Lisp blocks in the =elisp/emacs-audit.el=
        buffer, enclose them in org source blocks, and fix incorrect
        indentations
