** Install
*** From Melpa
    =emacs-audit= is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable. If you haven’t used
    Emacs’ package manager before, then it is high time you familiarize yourself
    with it by reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see
    (emacs)Packages. Then add one of the archives to package-archives:

    To use Melpa:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'package)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
    #+end_src
    To use Melpa-Stable:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'package)
    (add-to-list 'package-archives
                 '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
    #+end_src

    Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the local
    package list using:

    =M-x package-refresh-contents RET=

    Once you have done that, you can install =emacs-audit= and its dependencies
    using:

    =M-x package-install RET emacs-audit RET=

** Usage
   =M-x emacs-audit-list-packages RET=
